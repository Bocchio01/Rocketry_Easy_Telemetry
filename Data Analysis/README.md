## Update

Since I had no time before the flight to develop a decent script to analyze the data taken from the Flying Computer, I decided to do it in a more sophisticated way and I will probably create a specific portal on my website that will allow analyzing and retrieve the data in a more user-friendly way.

For this reason, I will not update this repository anymore, but as soon as I will have time I will commit to the Bocchio'sWebsite repository the new portal.

Of course, I will link it here as well.

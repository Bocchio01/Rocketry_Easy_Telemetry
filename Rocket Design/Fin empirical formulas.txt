The size of rocket fins is determined by a variety of factors, including the size and weight of the rocket, the altitude at which it will fly, and the desired stability and control characteristics. One commonly used formula for determining fin size is the "Fineness Ratio" formula, which is the ratio of the fin's root chord (the distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge at the point where the fin attaches to the rocket body) to the fin's span (the distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge at the tip of the fin). A fineness ratio of around 6 is considered optimal for most rockets. Another important factor to consider is the "fin area ratio" which is the ratio of the total fin area to the reference area of the rocket. This ratio can vary depending on the desired stability and control characteristics of the rocket but it is generally between 2% and 5%.It is also important to note that the size and shape of the fins can also affect the aerodynamics of the rocket, and as such, it is important to consult with experts in aerodynamics and rocketry when designing your rocket.
